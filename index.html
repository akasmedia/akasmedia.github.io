        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <h6>Posted on July 5th, 2019</h6>
        
        
        
        <p>
        <strong><em>AkasMedia</em></strong>
        started out as a facebook 
        advertising agency back in early 2019.<br> 
        Now the company has scaled up to doing 
        advertising on many more platforms such as
        Instagram, Snapchat, Whatsapp and Linkedin.<br>
        Business has been great ever since but websites
        was where the business really took off. <br>
        Every company doesn't need social media
        marketing to stay alive (yet) but, they do need
        some sort of online presence so a standard
        business website is a <strong><em>must
        </em></strong>.
        
         </p>
         
        <h2>The Visionaries</h2>
        
        <p> 
        In the beginning, there were two brilliant
        men. They both were looking for something more
        to do than the regular 9-5 hustle. They wanted
        more and so they researched day in and out. One
        day, the youngest of the two mentioned social
        media marketing just as he had heard it from his
        virtual mentor. Then a bulb sparked in the mind
        of the eldest of the two. He then mentioned to
        the younger one, why not use social media
        marketing for our business I'm sure you can
        learn that. Indeed he did learn it and then
        formed the company AkasMedia from it!
        </p>
        
        <h2>Progression was always Key</h2>
       
        <p> In the world of money what we were making
        wasn't much money. The good thing is that we saw
        this business' potential. In essence, feeding our business
        was what made much of a difference. We didnt't buy fancy clothing
        or bragged to others how nice our life was. We just kept it simple.
        Once the business grew more annually then we were satisfied because, now our
        end goal seemed closer than it was last year.
        
        
        <h2> The End Game </h2>
        
        In the end, what we really wanted to do was be with our real family.
        Setting up the infrastructure of where we belong.
        Helping our home become the magnificent place it should be.
